Discriminating Music Sequences Methode
Steps in reproducing the results of the research:
1. Install Orange Data Mining (https://orangedatamining.com/download/)
2. Create a Signals Folder for the .csv files (default folder saved in the .ows files is C:\SemnaleR\)
3. Download all .csv files in the Signals Folder
4. Download all Orange Data Mining files (.ows) either in the Signals folder or somewhere else
5. Run Orange Data Mining and load each .ows file.
6. Check that each of the _CSV File Import_ components has the correct path to the specific .csv file (if the default Signals Folder is created, is should work directly)
7. To view each plot, double click on each of the _Scatter Plot_ components.
