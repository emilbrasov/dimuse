Discriminating Music Sequences Methode
Steps in reproducing the results of the research:
1. Install Orange Data Mining (https://orangedatamining.com/download/)
2. Create a Signals Folder for all the files (default folder saved in the .ows files is C:\SemnaleR\) and unzip the files SemnaleR.zip
3. Download all .csv and .ows files in the Signals Folder
4. Run Orange Data Mining and load each .ows file.
5. Check that each of the _CSV File Import_ components has the correct path to the specific .csv file (if the default Signals Folder is created, is should work directly)
6. To view each plot, double click on each of the _Scatter Plot_ components.
